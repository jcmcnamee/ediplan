## Planning

### Database considerations

Tables:

1. Assets Table:

   - Attributes: UniqueID (Primary Key), Type, PricePerHour
   - This table holds common attributes for all assets.

<br>

2. PersonAttributes Table:

   - Attributes: UniqueID (Foreign Key referencing Assets), Name, Address
   - This table holds attributes specific to the "Person" asset type.

<br>

3. EquipmentAttributes Table:

   - Attributes: UniqueID (Foreign Key referencing Assets), Make, Model
   - This table holds attributes specific to the "Equipment" asset type.

<br>

4. RoomAttributes Table:
   - Attributes: UniqueID (Foreign Key referencing Assets), Size
   - This table holds attributes specific to the "Room" asset type.

#### Relationships:

- One-to-One Relationship:
  - Each entry in the Assets table corresponds to exactly one entry in either PersonAttributes, EquipmentAttributes, or RoomAttributes.
  - Use foreign keys in the specific attribute tables to link them to the Assets table.

#### Other Considerations:

1. Foreign Keys:

   - Each specific attribute table should have a foreign key referencing the Assets table.
   - This ensures that each entry in the attribute tables corresponds to a valid entry in the Assets table.

<br>

2. Joins:

   - When querying use JOIN operations to retrieve information about a specific asset type.
   - For efficiency it might be wise to index foreign keys and columns frequently used in joins.

<br>

1. Consistency:

   - Ensure data consistency by using transactions when updating related tables to maintain the integrity of the database.

<br>

4. Data Validation:

   - Implement checks and constraints to ensure that data entered adheres to the expected format and types.

<br>

5. Documentation:

   - Clearly document the relationships, foreign keys, and any constraints for future reference.

<br>

6. Testing:

   - Thoroughly test the database design with sample data to ensure that it meets your requirements and performs well.

### Data strctures

Each asset will need to be assigned a type on creation to account for different real world properties. Types will be analagous to predefined groups.

```
Class Asset {
    name: '',
    id: '',
    type: '',
    groups: [],
    isAvailable: true,
    pricePerHour: 0,

    // Methods
    book(startDate, endDate) {},
    checkAvailability(startDate, endDate) {},
}

Class Booking {
    id: 0,
    startDate: {}, // Format yet to be defined
    endDate: {},
    duration: 0, // Could this be derived?
    productionName: '',
    assets: [{}],
    guests: [''],
}
```
